# Space-Invaders
Recreating this iconic video game in Python and Pygame!
Special Focus on Object Oriented Programming (OOPS), using tons of classes and objects. 

## About the Game:
You are aboard the Millennium Falcon, with Han Solo, Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker! You have been attacked by Darth Vader himself, along with his army of Stormtroopers! Fortunately, you have two lightsabers with you, which you can fire from the Falcon. Help our heroes defeat the Lord of the Sith! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Details of the Game:

- Press 'D' to move right, 'A' to move left. 
- Press 'Spacebar' to fire a lightsaber, the weapon of the Jedi, which moves every towards the enemy every second 
- Click 'S' to fire another lightsaber, which moves at double the speed of the first one! If this collides with the enemy, it will exist on the board for another 5 seconds.
- The enemy will spawn every 10 seconds, and disappear after 8 seconds!

Hope you enjoy playing this game, as much as I enjoyed making it :grin:
